    <h1>Pawpaw Trees in Pittsburgh</h1>
    <p><strong>Asimina triloba</strong>, or the pawpaw tree, is a native fruit tree once abundant in Pittsburgh’s forests and river valleys. However, industrialization and urban development have greatly reduced its numbers.</p>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Once common along Pittsburgh’s rivers and floodplains, pawpaw trees declined due to deforestation, pollution, and habitat loss from industry and urban expansion.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Ecological Role & the Zebra Swallowtail</h2>
        <p>The pawpaw is the sole host plant for the zebra swallowtail butterfly (<i>Eurytides marcellus</i>). However, the butterfly is now rare in the region due to fragmented pawpaw populations.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why Aren’t Pawpaws Spreading?</h2>
        <p>Now extinct megafauna once dispersed pawpaw seeds, but recently there are fewer animals that consume the fruit and spread the seeds. With their absence, human intervention is needed to redistribute seeds.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>How to Help</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect and plant pawpaw seeds in suitable habitats (moist, shaded areas).</li>
            <li>Care for saplings by watering and protecting them from deer browsing.</li>
            <li>Plant along trails and waterways to reconnect habitats.</li>
